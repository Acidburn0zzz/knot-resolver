Generics library
----------------

This small collection of "generics" was born out of frustration that I couldn't find no
such thing for C. It's either bloated, has poor interface, null-checking is absent or
doesn't allow custom allocation scheme. BSD-licensed (or compatible) code is allowed here,
as long as it comes with a test case in `tests/test_generics.c`.
