Knot Resolver 1.2.0RC1 (2017-01-17)
===================================

Security:
---------
- In a policy.FORWARD() mode, the AD flag was copied from upstream
  response.  It is now cleared, as the policy.FORWARD() doesn't do
  DNSSEC validation yet.

Improvements:
-------------
- The DNSSEC Validation has been refactored, fixing many resolving
  failures.
- Add module `version` that checks for updates and CVEs periodically.
- Support RFC7830: EDNS(0) padding in responses over TLS.
- Support CD flag on incoming requests.
- hints module: previously /etc/hosts was loaded by default, but not anymore.
  Users can now actually avoid loading any file.

Miscelaneous:
-------------
- It now requires knot >= 2.3.1 to link successfully.
- The API+ABI for modules changed slightly.
